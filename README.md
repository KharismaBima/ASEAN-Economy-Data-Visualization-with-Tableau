## HI THERE!
Here is ASEAN Economy Report for you. This data visualization focuses on economy of ASEAN countries and its growth in 2020. The original datasets are accessible in <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator">Worldbank.org</a>, and this data vis uses some of them like GDP, GDP per capita, GDP annual growth, etc. Because the datasets are not too big so I cleaned the data using spreadsheet and made the visualization using <a href="https://public.tableau.com">Tableau Public</a>.

You can also check the dashboard version of this data vis by visiting my Tableau profil on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kharisma.bima#!/">here</a>. Have a wonderfull day!
